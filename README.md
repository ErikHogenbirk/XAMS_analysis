# XAMS_analysis
IPython notebooks used for analysis of XAMS data.

# Files included
Function_definitions.ipynb:

Contains a number of functions used in other analysis scripts.
At the start of your favourite analysis script, say 'import Function_definitions.ipynb' . That should do the trick.
If functions are added to the file, you first have to shut down the ipython kernel AND server (that means close all ipython notebook windows in your broswer and close it in the terminal) and then re-open the notebook before these functions are loaded. 

units.py:

Small package to deal with pax units.
